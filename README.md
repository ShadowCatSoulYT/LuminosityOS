# LuminosityOS 💡

LuminosityOS is a GUI-based operating system inspired by KolibriOS.  
This is a **passion project**, not a finished product, and not something you should daily-drive (yet ;]).

The main idea is to create a lightweight, everyday usable OS that gives users real freedom (for example you can modify system files freely, just.. dont mess up ok?),
without unnecessary complications or artificial limitations.

## Current State
Right now, LuminosityOS is in early early early early testing.
There is no real usability yet — things may boot, break, or do absolutely nothing useful.

Development is slow and experimental, and bugs and errors are checked roughly once a week.

## What works?
Honestly: **BARELY ANYTHING**.
The project is still being tested and explored, so stability and functionality are not guaranteed.

## Why this exists
- To learn low-level OS development because im sure it'll be useful for a 13 year old, right? RIGHT??
- To understand how kernels, booting, and GUIs work
- To eventually build a simple, lightweight OS made with passion, not profit (uneless you decide to support me :] )

## Long-term Goal
A fully everyday-usable operating system that:
- Is lightweight
- Has a GUI
- Gives users REAL freedom
- Is made out of passion, not corporate control ;)

## Testing
LuminosityOS is currently tested using **QEMU**.

## Warning ⚠️
- Made by a **very low-experience programmer**
- Development is EXTREMELY slow
- Bugs, crashes, and weird behavior are expected
- Things may randomly break
- If you install this i will not be responsible for any problems or damage!
- 
If you're here expecting a finished OS: this is not it.
If you're here to learn, explore, or just vibe with OS dev: welcome.
