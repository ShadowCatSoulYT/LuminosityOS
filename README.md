# LuminosityOS 🌌

LuminosityOS is a GUI-based operating system inspired by KolibriOS.  
This is a **passion project**, not a finished product, and not something you should daily-drive (yet).

The main idea is to create a lightweight, everyday usable OS that gives users real freedom,
without unnecessary complications or artificial limitations.

## Current State
Right now, LuminosityOS is in early testing.
There is no real usability yet — things may boot, break, or do absolutely nothing useful.

Development is slow and experimental, and progress is checked roughly once a week.

## What works?
Honestly: **unknown**.
The project is still being tested and explored, so stability and functionality are not guaranteed.

## Why this exists
- To learn low-level OS development
- To understand how kernels, booting, and GUIs work
- To eventually build a simple, lightweight OS made with passion, not profit

## Long-term Goal
A fully everyday-usable operating system that:
- Is lightweight
- Has a GUI
- Gives users real freedom
- Is made out of passion, not corporate control

## Testing
LuminosityOS is currently tested using **QEMU**.

## Warning ⚠️
- Made by a **low-experience programmer**
- Development is slow
- Bugs, crashes, and weird behavior are expected
- Things may randomly break

If you're here expecting a finished OS: this is not it.
If you're here to learn, explore, or just vibe with OS dev: welcome.
